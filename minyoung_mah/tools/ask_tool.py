"""Interactive clarification tool — ``ask_user_question``.

Pattern borrowed from Claude Code's AskUserQuestionTool. The LLM bundles
1–4 related questions, each with 2–4 multiple-choice options, and the
harness pauses graph execution via ``langgraph.types.interrupt()`` until
the user picks an answer. The CLI is responsible for rendering the
questions and supplying answers when it sees ``__interrupt__`` in the
graph state.

Why this exists
---------------
Vague user requirements ("build a PMS") cause the planner to invent
features the user never asked for, producing a 6× over-specced PRD.
Letting the planner ask first — "which tech stack? mobile or web only?
auth scope?" — replaces invented assumptions with user-verified facts.
